# MeLearningCstuff

Hello there :wave:

You've stumbled upon this github repository and are probably thinking, "why is your learning in a github repository".

Well, I have 2 different computers and I want to do my learning from both. I'm still in school so this will help me  work on small little leaarning projects between the two.

Another question you may ask is, "why is this public?". Well that's because I didn't care if it was public or private.

I'm mostly learning C for microcontroller stuff.
